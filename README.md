# shutdownPlz
A simple python script to shutdown the computer when the game on steam has finished downloading.

Dependency:
In order for this script to run you must have tesseract-ocr installed on your computer. You can download it from here https://digi.bib.uni-mannheim.de/tesseract/tesseract-ocr-setup-3.05.02-20180621.exe
However i did not create tesseract-ocr.
